/*
 * There was a sign extension bug in older revisions of this function. While
 * we would have liked to simply fix the bug and move on, we have to provide
 * a backwards compatibility feature (essentially the bug) for some systems and
 * a safety measure for some others. The latter is needed because for certain
 * multiple inputs to the buggy algorithm there exist easily found inputs to
 * the correct algorithm that produce the same hash. Thus, we optionally
 * deviate from the correct algorithm just enough to avoid such collisions.
 * While the bug itself affected the majority of passwords containing
 * characters with the 8th bit set (although only a percentage of those in a
 * collision-producing way), the anti-collision safety measure affects
 * only a subset of passwords containing the '\xff' character (not even all of
 * those passwords, just some of them). This character is not found in valid
 * UTF-8 sequences and is rarely used in popular 8-bit character encodings.
 * Thus, the safety measure is unlikely to cause much annoyance, and is a
 * reasonable tradeoff to use when authenticating against existing hashes that
 * are not reliably known to have been computed with the correct algorithm.
 *
 * We use an approach that tries to minimize side-channel leaks of password
 * information - that is, we mostly use fixed-cost bitwise operations instead
 * of branches or table lookups. (One conditional branch based on password
 * length remains. It is not part of the bug aftermath, though, and is
 * difficult and possibly unreasonable to avoid given the use of C strings by
 * the caller, which results in similar timing leaks anyway.)
 *
 * For actual implementation, we set an array index in the variable "bug"
 * (0 means no bug, 1 means sign extension bug emulation) and a flag in the
 * variable "safety" (bit 16 is set when the safety measure is requested).
 * Valid combinations of settings are:
 *
 * Prefix "$2a$": bug = 0, safety = 0x10000
 * Prefix "$2b$": bug = 0, safety = 0
 * Prefix "$2x$": bug = 1, safety = 0
 * Prefix "$2y$": bug = 0, safety = 0

 * If we have determined that we need to deviate from the correct algorithm,

 * let's stick to it now. It came out of the approach we used above, and it's
 * not any worse than any other choice we could make.)
 *
 * It is crucial that we don't do the same to the expanded key used in the main
 * Eksblowfish loop. By doing it to only one of these two, we deviate from a
 * state that could be directly specified by a password to the buggy algorithm
 * (and to the fully correct one as well, but that's a side-effect).
